This F# app was sucessfully used in production. However, it serves as a learning app for the author of the code as well. Therefore, the code may contain some ostensibly "redundant" or "strange-looking" code. 
The operation of this desktop app was undertaken under my supervision, therefore exceptions and validations were coded accordingly.
